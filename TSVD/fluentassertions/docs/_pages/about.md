## Why?

Nothing is more annoying than a unit test that fails without clearly explaining why. More than often, you need to set a breakpoint and start up the debugger to be able to figure out what went wrong. Jeremy D. Miller once gave the advice to "keep out of the debugger hell" and I can only agree with that.

For instance, only test a single condition per test case. If you don't, and the first condition fails, the test engine will not even try to test the other conditions. But if any of the others fail, you'll be on your own to figure out which one. I often run into this problem when developers try to combine multiple related tests that test a member using different parameters into one test case. If you really need to do that, consider using a parameterized test that is being called by several clearly named test cases.

Thatâ€™s why we designed Fluent Assertions to help you in this area. Not only by using clearly named assertion methods, but also by making sure the failure message provides as much information as possible. Consider this example:

```c#
string accountNumber = "1234567890";
accountNumber.Should().Be("0987654321");
```

This will be reported as:

> Expected accountNumber to be
"0987654321", but
"1234567890" differs near "123" (index 0).

The fact that both strings are displayed on a separate line is not a coincidence and happens if any of them is longer than 8 characters. However, if that's not enough, all assertion methods take an optional explanation (the because) that supports formatting placeholders similar to String.Format which you can use to enrich the failure message. For instance, the assertion

```c#
var numbers = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };
numbers.Should().Contain(item => item > 3, "at least {0} item should be larger than 3", 1);
```

will fail with:

> Expected numbers to have an item matching (item > 3) because at least 1 item should be larger than 3.

## Supported Frameworks and Libraries

Fluent Assertions cross-compiles to .NET Framework 4.5 and 4.7, as well as .NET Core 2.0, .NET Standard 1.3, 1.6 and 2.0. Because of that it supports the following minimum platforms.

*   .NET Framework 4.5
*   Mono, Xamarin.iOS 10.0, Xamarin.Mac 3.0 and Xamarin.Android 7.0
*   Univeral Windows Platform

Fluent Assertions supports the following unit test frameworks:

*   MSTest (Visual Studio 2010, 2012 Update 2, 2013 and 2015)
*   MSTest2 (Visual Studio 2017)
*   [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)
*   [XUnit](http://xunit.codeplex.com/)
*   [XUnit2](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/releases)
*   [MBUnit](http://code.google.com/p/mb-unit/)

## Versioning

The version numbers of Fluent Assertions releases comply to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme. In other words, release 1.4.0 only adds backwards-compatible functionality and bug fixes compared to 1.3.0. Release 1.4.1 should only include bug fixes. And if we ever introduce breaking changes, the number increased to 2.0.0.

## What do you need to compile the solution?

* Visual Studio 2017 or Jetbrains Rider and Build Tools 2017
* Windows 10
* .NET Core SDK 2.0 (Preview 2>)
